## Overview

This project is an addon for the **[Docker Mailserver](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver)** (DMS) project. It provides a simple web interface to manage email aliases. This addon is packaged as a Docker container that hosts a REST API written in Go and a frontend built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

## Features

- List existing mail aliases and the email address they redirect to.
- Add new aliases.
- Delete existing aliases.

## Technologies

- [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/)
- [Docker Engine SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/docker/docker/client)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run the Docker container, you will need:

- A working and configured [Docker Mailserver](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) instance.
- (Optional) A reverse proxy, e.g., [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), to serve the frontend over HTTPS.

### Configuration

You can change the port of the web server with the following environment variable:

```bash
export GIN_ADDR=":8080"
```

### Docker Compose

Add the `mailserver-aliases` container to your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  mailserver-aliases:
    image: chscheid/docker-mailserver-aliases:1.0.1
    restart: unless-stopped
    read_only: true
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
```

> **Note**: There is no built-in authentication for the frontend, so the web interface will be publicly available under port 8080. You may want to secure it with a reverse proxy and authentication.

#### Why Mounting the Docker Socket is Required

Mounting the Docker socket into the container is required for this project because the container needs to communicate with the Docker daemon to manage email aliases on the Docker Mailserver. The Docker Engine SDK is used to interact with the Docker daemon, allowing the REST API to list, add, and delete aliases.

#### Security Considerations

While mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container grants the container elevated permissions to interact with the Docker daemon, it is a common practice for tools that need to manage Docker containers. Here are some considerations to ensure this setup remains secure:

- **Restrict Access**: Protect the web interface by using a reverse proxy with authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the interface and perform actions.
- **Limit Container Capabilities**: Consider using Docker's security options to drop unnecessary capabilities from the container. For example, you can use the `--cap-drop` option to limit the containerâ€™s capabilities. 

#### Basic Authentication

Here is an example to serve the frontend with Caddy and Basic Authentication:

`docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.8
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - FRONTEND_BASIC_AUTH_USER="username"
      - FRONTEND_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="HASHED_PASSWORD"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile

  mailserver-aliases:
    image: chscheid/docker-mailserver-aliases:1.0.1
    read_only: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
```

`Caddyfile`:

```
aliases.yourdomain.com {
  basic_auth {
    {$FRONTEND_BASIC_AUTH_USER} {$FRONTEND_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD}
  }
  reverse_proxy mailserver-aliases:8080
}
```

Replace `username` and `HASHED_PASSWORD` with your values. For more information on configuring Caddy and hashing the password, see the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/basic_auth).

## Development

To develop and contribute to this project, you can run both the backend and frontend locally. You can mock the API for frontend development using [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/).

### REST API

The backend REST API is written in Go and provides endpoints to manage aliases. It interacts with the Docker Mailserver instance through the Docker Engine API.

#### Prerequisites

- Go (1.23 or higher)

#### Run Development Server

To start the development server for the backend:

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Swagger Documentation

The Swagger documentation is generated with [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag).

Generate the documentation with:

```bash
swag init
```

You can view the documentation at:

[http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html](http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html)

### Frontend

The frontend is built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI. It communicates with the backend REST API to manage email aliases.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (20 or higher)

#### Run Development Server

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ./frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Use Mockoon to mock the REST API if the Docker Mailserver is not running:

   ```bash
   npm run mockoon
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the frontend on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Future Improvements

### Goal: Remove the Dependency on Docker Socket Mounting

One of the goals for future development of this project is to eliminate the need to mount the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the container. Although mounting the Docker socket is currently required for the REST API to interact with the Docker Mailserver, this practice can pose security risks.
